# Hosting a Flask App on an EC2 Instance

## Step 1 - Setup Instance

Prepare EC2 instance:

* Make sure one is running.
* Make sure that you have the HTTP port, port 80, open in the Inbound security settings for your instance.
* I generally allocate an elastic IP address to these types of instances to make your life easier later on.

## Step 2 - Setup Code

Get all your stuff onto the instance. This potentially includes:

* App code.
* Python and libraries.
    * Download anaconda: `wget http://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda2-4.0.0-Linux-x86_64.sh`
    * Install anaconda: `bash Anaconda2-4.0.0-Linux-x86_64.sh`
* ...Profit?

## Step 3 - Setup Ports

Run the following line of code at the command line on the instance:

```
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8000
apt-get install iptables-persistent
```

The first line forwards requests at port 80 to port 8000. This is important.

The second line makes it so you can persist your iptable settings. When you run it you should be prompted to save your current iptable settings. Choose yes.

## Step 4 - Setup App

In the code for your app change the run method to the following:

```
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8000)
```

## Step 5 - Launch App

Launch your app. I would do this in tmux, though you can use screen.

## Step 6 - Test

Test everything is working by going to the public IP address of your instance in your browser.

## Step 7

I think this is where profit goes...?
